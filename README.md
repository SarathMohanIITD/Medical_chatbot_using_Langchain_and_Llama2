# Retrieval-Augmented Medical Conversational Bot

## Overview
This project implements a conversational bot designed for medical consultations. It leverages retrieval-augmented techniques to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses to users' medical inquiries. The bot integrates deep learning models with retrieval mechanisms to enhance its conversational capabilities.

## Features
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Utilizes state-of-the-art NLP models for understanding and generating medical-related queries and responses.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Mechanism:** Combines retrieval-based methods with generative models to improve the accuracy and relevance of responses.
- **Medical Domain-Specific Knowledge:** Pre-trained on medical datasets for better understanding of medical terminology and concepts.
- **Conversational AI:** Designed for engaging, human-like interactions with users.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SarathMohanIITD/Retrieval-Augmented-Medical-Conversational-Bot.git
    cd Retrieval-Augmented-Medical-Conversational-Bot
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the main script to start the bot:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage
Once the bot is running, you can interact with it by typing in your medical-related queries. The bot will use its trained models and retrieval mechanisms to provide accurate responses.

## Project Structure
- **`main.py`:** Entry point of the application.
- **`models/`:** Contains the deep learning models used by the bot.
- **`data/`:** Includes the datasets used for training and evaluation.
- **`utils/`:** Utility functions and helper scripts.
